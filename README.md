A site built with React.js for a friend that keeps track of KISS memorabilia made through the years.  Database through MongoDB with a UI for data entry.  Uploaded photos go to Cloudinary for storage, which then returns a URL for storage in the Mongo document for that same entry.  Search functionality coming very soon.  Hosted on Surge due to GitHub Pages' apparent incompatibility with React's BrowserRouter.
